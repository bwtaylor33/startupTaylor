> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Key features

- User login for security
- Database of books with their page number, genre, and overall review
- Allows you to rate books and track which books you have read
- Recommends new books based on friends and your collection of favorite books

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Used for structure. Will need separate pages. Will have a Registry Page, Home Page, Add Book Page, and a Browsing Page
- **CSS** - Used for decorating each page. Used to make a responsive layout for all viewports. Create grid for book selection.
- **React** - show homepage, buttons to add a book, browse library
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for: Registering logins, creating user profiles, validating logins, create new reviews, fetch bookshelf, get recommendations for users
- **DB/Login** - Stores users, books, reviews. Register and login users. Need to have authenticated login to leave a review.
- **WebSocket** - As new book is added to the shelf from a different login, it will be added automatically to the other user's shelf without refreshing.
